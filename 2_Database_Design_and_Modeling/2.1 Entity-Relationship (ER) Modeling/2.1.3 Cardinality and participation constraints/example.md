Sure! Here are more detailed examples of cardinality and participation constraints, along with text-based representations of ER diagrams to illustrate them.

### Example 1: One-to-One (1:1) Relationship
**Scenario: Person and Passport**

- **Entities:**
  - **Person**: PersonID (PK), Name
  - **Passport**: PassportID (PK), IssueDate

**Cardinality:** 1:1 (Each person has one passport)

**Participation:** Total for both entities (Every person must have a passport, and every passport is assigned to one person.)

**Diagram:**
```
 +-----------------+       +-----------------+
 |     Person      |       |     Passport     |
 |-----------------|       |-----------------|
 | PersonID (PK)   |<----->| PassportID (PK)  |
 | Name            |       | IssueDate       |
 +-----------------+       +-----------------+
```

### Example 2: One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship
**Scenario: Author and Books**

- **Entities:**
  - **Author**: AuthorID (PK), Name
  - **Book**: BookID (PK), Title, AuthorID (FK)

**Cardinality:** 1:N (An author can write many books)

**Participation:** Total for Author (Every author must write at least one book) and Partial for Book (A book is written by exactly one author, but not every author needs to have a book.)

**Diagram:**
```
 +-----------------+       +-----------------+
 |     Author      |       |      Book       |
 |-----------------|       |-----------------|
 | AuthorID (PK)   |<----- | BookID (PK)     |
 | Name            |       | Title           |
 +-----------------+       | AuthorID (FK)   |
                           +-----------------+
```

### Example 3: Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship
**Scenario: Student and Course**

- **Entities:**
  - **Student**: StudentID (PK), Name
  - **Course**: CourseID (PK), CourseName
  - **Enrollment**: StudentID (FK), CourseID (FK)

**Cardinality:** M:N (Students can enroll in many courses, and courses can have many students)

**Participation:** Partial for both (Not every student must enroll in a course, and not every course needs to have students enrolled.)

**Diagram:**
```
 +-----------------+       +------------------+       +-----------------+
 |     Student     |       |    Enrollment     |       |      Course     |
 |-----------------|       |------------------|       |-----------------|
 | StudentID (PK)  |<----- | StudentID (FK)   |       | CourseID (PK)   |
 | Name            |       | CourseID (FK)    |<----- | CourseName      |
 +-----------------+       +------------------+       +-----------------+
```

### Example 4: One-to-Many with Additional Constraints
**Scenario: Library and Book Copies**

- **Entities:**
  - **Library**: LibraryID (PK), Name
  - **BookCopy**: CopyID (PK), ISBN, LibraryID (FK)

**Cardinality:** 1:N (A library can have multiple book copies)

**Participation:** Total for Library (Every library must have at least one book copy) and Partial for BookCopy (Not every book copy needs to be in a library.)

**Diagram:**
```
 +-----------------+       +-----------------+
 |     Library     |       |   BookCopy      |
 |-----------------|       |-----------------|
 | LibraryID (PK)  |<----- | CopyID (PK)     |
 | Name            |       | ISBN            |
 +-----------------+       | LibraryID (FK)  |
                           +-----------------+
```

### Example 5: Many-to-Many with Additional Attributes
**Scenario: Project and Employee**

- **Entities:**
  - **Project**: ProjectID (PK), ProjectName
  - **Employee**: EmployeeID (PK), Name
  - **ProjectAssignment**: ProjectID (FK), EmployeeID (FK), HoursWorked

**Cardinality:** M:N (A project can involve multiple employees, and an employee can work on multiple projects)

**Participation:** Partial for both (Not every employee needs to work on a project, and not every project needs to have employees assigned.)

**Diagram:**
```
 +-----------------+       +---------------------+       +-----------------+
 |     Project     |       |   ProjectAssignment  |       |    Employee     |
 |-----------------|       |---------------------|       |-----------------|
 | ProjectID (PK)  |<----- | ProjectID (FK)      |       | EmployeeID (PK) |
 | ProjectName     |       | EmployeeID (FK)     |<----- | Name            |
 +-----------------+       | HoursWorked         |       +-----------------+
                           +---------------------+
```

### Summary of Diagrams
- Each diagram shows entities connected by relationships with the appropriate cardinality and participation constraints.
- **Cardinality** (1:1, 1:N, M:N) indicates the number of instances that can be associated.
- **Participation** (Total or Partial) indicates whether all instances of an entity must participate in the relationship.

These examples illustrate how cardinality and participation constraints are crucial for accurately modeling data relationships in a database.
