SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with databases. The basic SQL commands you mentioned are essential for performing various operations on the data stored in a database. Hereâ€™s an overview of each:

### 1. `SELECT`

- **Purpose**: Retrieves data from a database.
- **Syntax**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName
  FROM Employees
  WHERE Department = 'Sales';
  ```
  This query selects the `FirstName` and `LastName` columns from the `Employees` table where the `Department` is 'Sales'.

### 2. `INSERT`

- **Purpose**: Adds new records to a table.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
  VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, HireDate)
  VALUES (4, 'Emily', 'Clark', 'HR', '2024-08-07');
  ```
  This query inserts a new record into the `Employees` table with specified values for each column.

### 3. `UPDATE`

- **Purpose**: Modifies existing records in a table.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE table_name
  SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
  WHERE condition;
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE Employees
  SET Department = 'Marketing'
  WHERE EmployeeID = 2;
  ```
  This query updates the `Department` of the employee with `EmployeeID` 2 to 'Marketing'.

### 4. `DELETE`

- **Purpose**: Removes records from a table.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Employees
  WHERE EmployeeID = 4;
  ```
  This query deletes the record of the employee with `EmployeeID` 4 from the `Employees` table.

### Summary

- **`SELECT`**: Retrieves data based on specific criteria.
- **`INSERT`**: Adds new data to a table.
- **`UPDATE`**: Changes existing data in a table.
- **`DELETE`**: Removes data from a table.

These commands allow you to manage and manipulate data within your database effectively.
